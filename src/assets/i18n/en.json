    "ABOUT_TEXT": "The program consists of 3 stages. There may be requirements for advancing to each higher stage, which will be described below. This specific run of the program will take the form of self-study. This means that you will have access to pre-recorded webinars, recommended materials, and weekly live Q&A sessions with our mentors/coordinators to answer any questions you might have. You will also have the ability to communicate with other students and help each other solve any problems you might face. We will provide you with a list of topics that should be covered for each stage with recommended deadlines, but you will have the freedom to choose when you want to watch the lectures and complete the tasks. BE AWARE that practical tasksâ€™ deadlines are not suggestions, and should be respected.",
